## My process

### Built with

- Only basic HTML and CSS

### What I learned

```html
 There wasn't any kind of special code in HTML in my code I think.
```
```css
@media (max-width: 476px){
      main{
        margin-top:45%;
      } 
    } 
 
```

### Continued development

I am not completely clear about some things in CSS like placing an item in the center of the website. I think there is a better way to take the main section in the center of this html file. Please tell me if you know any better way.

### Useful resources

I learned from youtube videos. I watched and completed some playlists of some programmers in YouTube. It was a very basic challenge and so this didn't force me to take any help from the internet
